# AespaGameProject

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

This project is part of UE5 learning process, as well as try to develop idea while learning. Updates will probably be slow or in chunks as I learn parts and work on certain idea bits.

## **PROGRESS**:

- main menu with fully functional buttons
- character selection with functional character buttons, text updating and image updating (image to be changed into character)
- after character selection loading screen plays video according to selected character
- loading level functional (to be updated to look better)
- health bar
- pickupitem, used to increase health, gets appropriate symbol base on selected character - item can be taken only if health is below or equal 80
- added sprint input (left ctrl)
- rotating auto save material made and inserted into loading level widget
- pause menu
- load game on main menu - if there is not save game it shows message, otherwise opens last saved game
- load game on pause menu - opens last saved game (in case of just started level just restars level)
- save game on pause menu - saves character position and stats (will be revisited cause it seems that not everything is functioning properly - used items/enemies especially need to be checked)
- checkpoint item (currently as collision box in space) - saves character position and stats (will be revisited cause it seems that not everything is functioning properly - used items/enemies especially need to be checked)
