# AespaGameProject

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

This project is part of UE5 learning process, as well as try to develop idea while learning. Updates will probably be slow or in chunks as I learn parts and work on certain idea bits.

## **PROGRESS**:
- main menu with fully functional buttons
- character selection with functional character buttons, text updating and image updating (image to be changed into character)
- loading level functional (to be updated to look better)
- health bar
- pickupitem, used to increase health, gets appropriate symbol base on selected character - item can be taken only if health is below or equal 80
- added sprint input (left ctrl)
